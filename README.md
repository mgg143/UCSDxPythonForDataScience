"Going the Distance: How Commute Time Affects Performance

Abstract
A data set combination of student performance and potentially relevant student 
characteristics from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used to help identify any 
relationship between commute time and student performance, which could potentially be 
extrapolated to influence commute-related educational decisions and public policy.  The data 
sets were manipulated and analyzed using the pandas software library, written in the Python 
programming language, establishing clear correlations between data attributes.  Matplotlib 
and seaborn, a matplotlib enhancement, were used to visualize the correlations between 
data set attributes, primarily through the use of pairplots.  This reportâ€™s analyses established 
a clear negative correlation between student commute time and performance from the data.  
However, due to the highly limited data set and statistical limitations of this report, additional 
research into commuting and human performance is needed to generate more 
comprehensive conclusions that might help influence public or educational policy. "
