"Unlocking Potential: 

Identifying Data-Driven Ways for an Aspiring Player to Improve Their Perceived Value and Potential"

++

"Motivation

Pre-professional athletes are often competing against a large pool of their peers for a very limited number of professional positions.  In many cases, these players have worked for more than a decade to hone their sport-specific abilities and get noticed by teams that could take them on.  As the probability of success in this regard is dishearteningly low, any evidence-based guidance in improving a playerâ€™s odds for selection would be extremely valuable.  Instead of operating off hunches, superstition and perceived trends; data-driven insights to help a player improve their perceived potential would be incredibly valuable for the player and what is often their dedicated network of supporters.  


To help supply these insights, data science principles can be used to analyze data from current players and their potential rating to help determine if any particular player attributes are notably related.  Armed with the European Soccer Database and its catalog of more than 10,000 players and their statistics, we hope our analyses can help identify any relationships that may help these players in their professional pursuits.
